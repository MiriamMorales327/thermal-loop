# Multi-domain Models

## Emulator Level
* A Simscape model of the thermal loop as built in C004G
* Used for developing a DT of the thermal loop


### What follows if from MAtt's upload. 
* Update as needed. 
**PRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR FOR A SMALL MODULAR REACTOR**

The models here conatain variations of a thermal loop for a pressurized water reactor system in a small modular reactor. 
The thermal loop consists of 2 main cycles;

~primary - the loop containg the fluid flow through the reactor to the steam generator

~secondary - the loop used to generate electricity from the steam in the steam generator
