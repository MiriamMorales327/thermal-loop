**PRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR FOR A SMALL MODULAR REACTOR**

The models here conatain variations of a thermal loop for a pressurized water reactor system in a small modular reactor. 
The thermal loop consists of 2 main cycles;

~primary - the loop containg the fluid flow through the reactor to the steam generator

~secondary - the loop used to generate electricity from the steam in the steam generator
